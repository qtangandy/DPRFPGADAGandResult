--DAGs 
	records the used DAG models.
	--.dag
		the DAG model.
		The line begins with tab represents an edge; otherwise, it is a task, which begines with the task name, and followed by the execution time on the FPGA and the CLB number of the task. 
		The edges of a task is listed after the line of the task, each begines with tab, followed which is the destination task name, edge cost, edge name.
	--.dot
		using graphviz to visualize the DAG.
	
	
--results
	records the partitioning and scheduling results.
	--Res_0.4
		results of the experiment with the FPGA resource being 40% of that of the DAG.
	--Res_0.6
		results of the experiment with the FPGA resource being 60% of that of the DAG.
